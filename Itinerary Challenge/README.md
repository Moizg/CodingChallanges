## Find the Itinerary in Alphabetical Order

You are given a list of airline tickets, where each ticket is a pair [from, to] representing a flight from one airport to another.

Your task is to reconstruct the complete travel route in the correct order.

All trips start from airport "A".

If there are multiple possible routes, return the one that comes first in alphabetical order (when read as a single string).
## Examples
```
findPath([["C", "F"], ["A", "C"], ["I", "Z"], ["F", "I"]])
output = ["A", "C", "F", "I", "Z"]

findPath([["A","C"],["A","B"],["C","B"],["B","A"],["B","C"]]
output = ["A","B","A","C","B","C"]
#Another valid route is ["A","C","B","A","B","C"],
#but it comes later alphabetically.

findPath([["Y", "L"], ["D", "A"], ["A", "D"], ["R", "Y"], ["A", "R"]])
output = ["A", "D", "A", "R", "Y", "L"]
```
## Notes

- Every ticket must be used exactly once.

- There will always be at least one valid route.

- When comparing routes alphabetically, for example:
    ["A", "B"] < ["A", "C"].
